## Introduction :raising_hand:
I take this opportunity to introduce myself as Divita Pal from India, currently pursuing *Master of Engineering* at University of British Columbia in the *Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering*. I came to vancouver last year in August and started school on September 2017. I chose UBC as it is at the forefront of education, have a fabulous research status and flexible academic curriculum. Moreover, Canada was the best option to pursue higher education as it has developed a first-rated education system with high standards and global recognition. As it is a country of immigrants from all over the world and therefore different perspectives are respected and learning together is encouraged. Also, Vancouver is a peaceful and orderly city with a diverse and vibrant culture and moderate climate conditions.

## Early Life 
According to me
> Engineering is the branch of science and technology that involves learning the fundamental and basic concepts and applying them to produce innovative and practical applications out of it.

At a very early age I realized that not only was engineering an interesting field, it also had myriad opportunities that lead to the path of success. Consistently achieving excellence in subjects like maths and science in middle school further strengthened my interest. I developed a liking for chemistry; particularly experimentation attracted me a lot. During my final year I received high distinction award in the *Australian Chemistry Quiz*. All these appreciation encouraged me to pursue **Chemical Engineering** as my undergraduate course at **National Institute of Technology Raipur**.
